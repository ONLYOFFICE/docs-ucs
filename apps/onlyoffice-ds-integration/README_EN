<p>
	To start using ONLYOFFICE Docs Enterprise Edition with Nextcloud, ownCloud or Seafile, you have to install the respective app and enable the ONLYOFFICE plugin in either app.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Note</b>: You have to uninstall the community version of&nbsp;ONLYOFFICE Docs from UCS before installing ONLYOFFICE Docs Enterprise Edition to avoid conflicts between the solutions. Several instances and solutions of ONLYOFFICE cannot be hosted together within UCS.
</p>
<p>
	The address to the document server has to be configured inside the plugin. Pleaes note that the parameter <b> documentserver </b> is the name (FQDN, without a port number) of the server with the ONLYOFFICE Docs Enterprise Edition installed. The address must be accessible for the user browser and from the respective Nextcloud, ownCloud or Seafile server. The server address must also be accessible from ONLYOFFICE Docs Enterprise Edition for operating correctly.
</p>
<pre>
    https://&lt;documentserver&gt;/onlyoffice-documentserver
</pre>
<p>
	It is necessary that you open the storage applications like Nextcloud, ownCloud or Seafile with hostname of the UCS system and not with the IP address in the addressbar of your browser. Otherwise, ONLYOFFICE can't open the documents.
